  <h1>About Kelly</h1>
  <p>Hello <strike>world</strike><strong>(ooops!)</strong> classmates! I'm not to sure what y'all want to know but here's a little about me:</p>
  <p>I'm here to change my life and get out of the cycle of working jobs that require you work yourself to death to excel.</p>
  <p>I'm sure I'll still have to push my limits to excel but well in corrections I've worked more than a handful of 24+ hour shifts.</p>
  <p>This was me before working in corrections...</p>

  <p>...and then there is me after corrections.</p>

  <p>After some time away from the field it allowed me to return to a state more like myself.</p>
  <p>Here I am now</p>
