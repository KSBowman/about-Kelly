  <h3>HELLO WORLD!</h3>
  <p>I'm Kelly.  Here are some quick facts about me</p>
  <ul>
      <li>I worked in corrections for 15 years and I am <strong>FREE</strong> now</li>
      <li>I love all thing Japanese, especially <strong>SUMO</strong> and <strong>KABUKI</strong></li>
      <li>I worked in network administration but found it... dull...</li>
      <li>Now I am changing careers and looking to work in something I am passionate about</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My first thought for a new career was that I will<br/><strong>DOMINATE THE SPORT OF SUMO</strong>!</p>

  <p>But I think I will never be able to make weight and be competitive despite my fierce techniques</p>
  <p>So I thought about<br/><strong>THE ART OF KABUKI!</strong></p>

  <p>But I would have to be graceful and be able to move... very... very... <strong>SLOWLY</strong></p>
  <p>Since there is not much of either here in the <strong>USA</strong> and I am a nerd at heart...</p>
  <p>Maybe I will be a software developer... <br/>As long as I can do this every so often...</p>
